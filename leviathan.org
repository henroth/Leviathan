** Prove out comms
*** DONE Rasberry Pi $40
*** DONE Flash card
- need to install Raspbian
*** ORDERED Xbee $40 x2
*** ORDERED Xbee explorer for laptop interface $25 (maybe on for Rasberry pi too?)
** Prove out motor control
Brushed or brushless?
Motor control board $10-$30?
 -L298N
https://www.pololu.com/product/2753
Two motors?

Props and prop shafts?
** Last bits
Platform ??
GPS module $30-$40
imu ???
Battery/ Terminal.
   - Motor battery
   - Rasberry pi battery
   - Voltage regulator: L7805 LM7805 Three Terminal Voltage Regulator Module For Arduino

* Setup
** Rasberry Pi
Download NOOBS from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
Install ROS http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu
** PC
Install ROS http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
- have to install from source
- installed ros_comms, robot and perception variants
  - needed to run the following to install multiple variants 
    > wstool merge whatever.rosinstall -t src
    > wstool update -t src
** Both
*** ROS packages
rosserial_xbee
** Next steps
*** DONE hook pi to network, update
*** TODO Install ros on pi
*** TODO create catkin workspace and beginning of Leviathan package
*** TODO configure xbees
*** TODO wire xbee for pi
*** TODO Write simple comms node for pc -> pi
